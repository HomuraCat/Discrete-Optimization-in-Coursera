## solver_RLF.py
Use recursive largest first algorithm(greedy), get 18pts.

## solver_backtracking.py
brute_force: simplest dfs

trick_force: Search the next node by its choosable color number (smaller first)

magic_force: Use the property of symmetry prune, propagation. Search by the degree in decreasing order. (get 51pts)

sat_force: (maybe delete by mistake), use sat-solver to find. The speed is similar to trick_force.
