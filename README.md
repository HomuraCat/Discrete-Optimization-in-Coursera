# Grade
1. knapsack (60/60pts): dfs + branch and bound. Use DP in small data (dfs+branch and bound can solved 60pts, but I just coded it)
2. coloring (51/60pts): dfs + prune
3. tsp (60/60pts): guided local search (in tsp.cpp)
4. facility (62/80pts): SAR. Maybe guided local search can get the 80pts.
5. vrp (60/60pts): greedy + method in tsp + split point trick (in vrp.cpp)
